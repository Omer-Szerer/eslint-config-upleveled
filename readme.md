## Setup

Regardless of which environment you have for your project, the first steps are to install the dependencies and add the file:

```sh
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-cypress
```

Then create a file in the root of your project called `.eslintrc.js` and add the content of [the `.eslintrc.js` file](https://github.com/upleveled/upleveled-vscode-eslint-base-config/blob/main/.eslintrc.js).

If you are using `create-react-app`, this is enough! You're ready to go.

If your app is not using `create-react-app`, read on:

### Without `create-react-app`

If your application does not use `create-react-app` (eg. Node.js or Next.js), then you will need to also run the following command:

```sh
npx install-peerdeps --dev --yarn eslint-config-react-app
```

### Verify Setup

To verify that the configuration is working properly, you can try pasting the contents of [`__tests__/index.js`](./__tests__index.js) into a new file and seeing whether you get the same warning messages.
