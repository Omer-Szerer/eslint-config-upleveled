# UpLeveled ESLint Config

UpLeveled ESLint defaults for programming in JavaScript, React and Node.js.

## Setup

To add ESLint configuration to a project, the first steps are to install the dependencies and add the file:

```sh
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-cypress
```

Then create a file in the root of your project called `.eslintrc.js` and add the content of [the `.eslintrc.js` file](https://github.com/upleveled/upleveled-vscode-eslint-base-config/blob/main/.eslintrc.js).

If you are using `create-react-app` in this project, this is enough! You're ready to go.

If the project doesn't use `create-react-app`, read on:

### Without `create-react-app`

With projects that don't use `create-react-app` (eg. Node.js or Next.js), then you will need to also run the following command:

<!--
  TODO: Fix this installation command when new CRA version comes out
  eg. npx install-peerdeps --dev --yarn eslint-config-react-app
  Ref: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/9434#issuecomment-696566848
-->

```sh
yarn add upleveled/eslint-config-upleveled
npx install-peerdeps --dev --yarn -o eslint-config-upleveled
yarn remove eslint-config-upleveled
```

### Verify Setup

To verify that the configuration is working properly, you can try pasting the contents of [`__tests__/index.js`](./__tests__/index.js) into a new file and seeing whether you get the same warning messages as in the screenshot at the beginning of the readme (you may need to hover over the words underlined with orange / red squiggly lines).
